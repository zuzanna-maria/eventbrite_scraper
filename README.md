# eventbrite_scraper
A webscraper which scrapes search results for given terms from Eventbrite (event name, link, date, and location) and automatically uploads it to Google Sheets.


Works with Firefox web browser; requires a Firefox web driver (can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and a Google Drive account (the login credentials to which should be stored in a file called 'scraper_credentials.json').
